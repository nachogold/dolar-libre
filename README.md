This simple flask app scrapes 3 different Argentinian websites to gather the "Dolar Blue" exchange rate and displays the rates, along with the average exchange rate, in a one-page site. The data is refreshed every 10 minutes to have the latest exchange rate information.

This is my first flask app, which was successfully deployed using an Oracle Cloud Ubuntu server.
